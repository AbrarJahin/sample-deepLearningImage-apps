# Image Tagging

## Use Deep Learning to Identify Features in an Image

This is a demo of the [IllustrationTagger](https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/deeplearning/IllustrationTagger) running on Algorithmia, which uses state-of-the-art deep learning to identify places in images.  Simply provide an image, and state-of-the-art deep learning will identify features which are present.
