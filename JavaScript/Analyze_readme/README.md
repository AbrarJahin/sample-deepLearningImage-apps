Middleman is a tool you can use to build and serve your site while in development.

Run the following command to have Middleman load your site and watch at `http://0.0.0.0:4567`:

```bash
$ middleman server
```

To build the site, run the following command:

```bash
$ middleman build
```

This will build the project into a `build` folder. Upload this to your preferred site for hosting static content and you're done! Wow!

Note: You can also modify the build and configure it to your liking in the `config.rb` file. You might also need to install missing gems & install the bower components if you do not have them.
