      <h4>Your README's Overall Grade</h4>
      	<p>
      		Your overall score is calculated as an average of your README's headers, code samples, length, text, and image scores. Each section provides insights and suggestions for improving the quality of your README relative to the 10,000 popular repositories we've analyzed. 
      	</p>
      	<p>
      		These grades are the result of data science and machine learning, and are provided on a "best effort" basis. Ultimately, you should use your own judgement about what to include, remove, and ignore. Inevitably, there will be results that don't make sense. Feel free to <a href="https://algorithmia.com/contact" target="_blank">contact us</a> if you feel something is particularly egregious. 
      	</p>
      	<p>A few assumptions we made when training our model:</p> 
      	<ul>
     			<li>
    				Popular repositories probably have a good, well-documented README
    			</li>
    			<li>
    				Popular repositories have more stars than bad repositories 
    			</li>
  			<li>
  				Each programming language has unique characteristics
  			</li>
        </ul>
        		<p>
        			In general, we found <b>higher</b> correlations between a README's quality and the specific headers, and the words used throughout. Conversely, we found a <b>lower</b> correlations between a README's length, the number of code samples, the number of images, and the quality of the README. 
        		</p>
            <p>
              In order to correct this, we removed any repository that had fewer than 1,500 characters, zero images, or zero code snippets from our model.
            </p>

      		<b>How was this made?</b>

<!--       	<p>
      		We used a <a href="#">data science approach to analyzing README's</a>, and then <a href="#">hosted our model on Algorithmia</a>, which made it available as a serverless API endpoint.
