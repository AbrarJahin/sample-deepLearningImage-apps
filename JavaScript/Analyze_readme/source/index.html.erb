      <p>Creating good readmes can be really challenging. This is especially true given the fact that there's no official standard to follow. One approach for solving this problem could be to go through the top starred repositories on github and find common features in each of them. Going through hundreds of repositories can be time consuming, slow process.

      This algorithm uses machine learning models to learn from the 1000 starred repositories for the top 10 programming languages (that has the most repositories) on Github. It gives your project readme a score between A-F, and makes recommendations to make your readme more similar to the top readmes on GitHub.</p>
