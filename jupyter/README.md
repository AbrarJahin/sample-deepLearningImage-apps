# Algorithmia Sample Apps: Jupyter Notebooks

It is easy to call Algorithmia APIs from right within a Jupyter notebook... open any .ipynb file to experiment.

To run notebooks locally, see http://jupyter.org/install

To quickly try one out on a remote server, see http://mybinder.org

Find more information in the [Algorithmia Developer Center](http://developers.algorithmia.com) or the [API Docs](http://docs.algorithmia.com/).
